Learn You Node

**My solutions to self-guided workshops on Node.js by learnyounode.**

Node.js is a [program](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that
you install on your computer. With Node.js you can use the very popular
[programming](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) language
[JavaScript](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) to write
[software](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software).

JavaScript is usually used in a
[browser](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) like
[Internet Explorer](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer) or
[Safari](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)) but with
Node.js it is possible to do a lot more.

Combined with other tools, Node.js allows you to write
[Desktop](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) applications
like [Word](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) or
[iTunes](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes), Server applications
like [Apache](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server),
Network applications like [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or even mobile
applications for the iPhone or Android.
